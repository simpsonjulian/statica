In these attacks, the vulnerable site is loaded in a frame on an attacker-controlled site which uses opaque or transparent layers to trick the user into unintentionally clicking a button or link on the vulnerable site.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSet the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header to `DENY`, to instruct web browsers to block attempts to load the site in a frame.

If user input is passed to this API, it could allow a malicious user to add extra content that could corrupt or supersede existing content, or enable unintended additional functionality.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid using the `WriteRaw` method on `System.Xml.XmlWriter` with user input. If possible, use the high-level APIs to write new XML elements to a document, as these automatically escape user content. If that is not possible, then user input should be escaped before being included in a string that will be used with the `WriteRaw` API.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, user input is provided describing the name of an employee to add to an XML document representing a set of names.

The first is to escape user input before passing it to the `WriteRaw` API, which prevents a malicious user from closing or opening XML tags. The second approach uses the high level XML API to add XML elements, which ensures the content is appropriately escaped.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Security;\nusing System.Web;\nusing System.Xml;\n\npublic class XMLInjectionHandler : IHttpHandler {\n  public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx) {\n    string employeeName = ctx.Request.QueryString[\"employeeName\"];\n\n    using (XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(\"employees.xml\"))\n    {\n        writer.WriteStartDocument();\n\n        // GOOD: Escape user input before inserting into string\n        writer.WriteRaw(\"<employee><name>\" + SecurityElement.Escape(employeeName) + \"</name></employee>\");\n\n        // GOOD: Use standard API, which automatically encodes values\n        writer.WriteStartElement(\"Employee\");\n        writer.WriteElementString(\"Name\", employeeName);\n        writer.WriteEndElement();\n\n        writer.WriteEndElement();\n        writer.WriteEndDocument();\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## References\n* Web Application Security Consortium: [XML Injection](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13247004/XML%20Injection).\n* Microsoft Docs: [WriteRaw](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmlwriter.writeraw?view=netframework-4.8).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-91](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/91.html).\n",

Using a type resolver means that arbitrary code may be executed.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Web.UI.WebControls;\nusing System.Web.Script.Serialization;\n\nclass Bad\n{\n    public static object Deserialize(TextBox textBox)\n    {\n        JavaScriptSerializer sr = new JavaScriptSerializer(new SimpleTypeResolver());\n        // BAD\n        return sr.DeserializeObject(textBox.Text);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nTo fix this specific vulnerability, we avoid using a type resolver. In other cases, it may be necessary to use a different deserialization framework.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Web.UI.WebControls;\nusing System.Web.Script.Serialization;\n\nclass Good\n{\n    public static object Deserialize(TextBox textBox)\n    {\n        JavaScriptSerializer sr = new JavaScriptSerializer();\n        // GOOD: no unsafe type resolver\n        return sr.DeserializeObject(textBox.Text);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nIn the following example potentially untrusted stream and type is deserialized using a `DataContractJsonSerializer` which is known to be vulnerable with user supplied types.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization.Json;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\n\nclass BadDataContractJsonSerializer\n{\n    public static object Deserialize(string type, Stream s)\n    {\n        // BAD: stream and type are potentially untrusted\n        var ds = new DataContractJsonSerializer(Type.GetType(type));\n        return ds.ReadObject(s);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nTo fix this specific vulnerability, we are using hardcoded Plain Old CLR Object ([POCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object)) type. In other cases, it may be necessary to use a different deserialization framework.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization.Json;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\n\nclass Poco\n{\n    public int Count;\n\n    public string Comment;\n}\n\nclass GoodDataContractJsonSerializer\n{\n    public static Poco Deserialize(Stream s)\n    {\n        // GOOD: while stream is potentially untrusted, the instantiated type is hardcoded\n        var ds = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Poco));\n        return (Poco)ds.ReadObject(s);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Mu&ntilde;oz, Alvaro and Mirosh, Oleksandr: [JSON Attacks](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-Json-Attacks.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html).\n"

These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`). If these file paths are used to create a filesystem path, then a file operation may happen in an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nFor example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.\n\nThe recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to:\n\n1. Use `Path.Combine(destinationDirectory, archiveEntry.FullName)` to determine the raw output path.\n1. Use `Path.GetFullPath(..)` on the raw output path to resolve any directory traversal elements.\n1. Use `Path.GetFullPath(destinationDirectory + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar)` to determine the fully resolved path of the destination directory.\n1. Validate that the resolved output path `StartsWith` the resolved destination directory, aborting if this is not true.\nAnother alternative is to validate archive entries against a whitelist of expected files.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, a file path taken from a zip archive item entry is combined with a destination directory. The result is used as the destination file path without verifying that the result is within the destination directory. If provided with a zip file containing an archive path like `..\\sneaky-file`, then this file would be written outside the destination directory.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.IO.Compression;\n\nclass Bad\n{\n    public static void WriteToDirectory(ZipArchiveEntry entry,\n                                        string destDirectory)\n    {\n        string destFileName = Path.Combine(destDirectory, entry.FullName);\n        entry.ExtractToFile(destFileName);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we need to make three changes. Firstly, we need to resolve any directory traversal or other special characters in the path by using `Path.GetFullPath`. Secondly, we need to identify the destination output directory, again using `Path.GetFullPath`, this time on the output directory.

The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor C\\#, `RNGCryptoServiceProvider` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. `Random` is not cryptographically secure, and should be avoided in security contexts. For contexts which are not security sensitive, `Random` may be preferable as it has a more convenient interface, and is likely to be faster.\n\nFor the specific use-case of generating passwords, consider `System.Web.Security.Membership.GeneratePassword`, which provides a cryptographically secure method of generating random passwords.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a password.\n\nIn the first case, we generate a fresh password by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated password.\n\nIn the second example, a cryptographically secure random number generator is used for the same purpose. In this case, it is much harder to predict the generated integers.\n\nIn the final example, the password is generated using the `Membership.GeneratePassword` library method, which uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a random series of characters. This method should be preferred when generating passwords, if possible, as it avoids potential pitfalls when converting the output of a random number generator (usually an int or a byte) to a series of permitted characters.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Security.Cryptography;\nusing System.Web.Security;\n\nstring GeneratePassword()\n{\n    // BAD: Password is generated using a cryptographically insecure RNG\n    Random gen = new Random();\n    string password = \"mypassword\" + gen.Next();\n\n    // GOOD: Password is generated using a cryptographically secure RNG\n    using (RNGCryptoServiceProvider crypto = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())\n    {\n        byte[] randomBytes = new byte[sizeof(int)];\n        crypto.GetBytes(randomBytes);\n        password = \"mypassword\" + BitConverter.ToInt32(randomBytes);\n    }\n\n    // BAD: Membership.GeneratePassword generates a password with a bias\n    password = Membership.GeneratePassword(12, 3);\n\n    return password;\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia.
